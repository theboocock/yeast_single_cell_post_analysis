#We asked whether the effects of eQTLs varied across the different stages of the cell-cycle. Of the 2,945 total local eQTLs detected in the three crosses, only 116 (4%) showed 
#significant interactions between the eQTL effect and the cell-cycle stage at an FDR of 5%.

#  In contrast, 790 (24.4%) of 3,238 distal eQTLs showed significant
#interactions with the cell-cycle stage (OR=7.8, Fisherâ€™s exact test, P < 2.2e-16),
